    # HORISEON REFACTOR HOMEWORK


    For this assignment I made pretty simple changes in the index.html file by changing the div elements to proper semantics like Header, Nav, Main, Body, Aside, and Footer. I created the title Horiseon and also added in comments to keep the code clean and properly organized.

    I made sure all the <a> elements were functional and lead you to the proper section. All proper alt properties were also assigned to the <img> elements.

    For the CSS file I changed the selectors to respond to the updated elements in the HTML file. I also added comments and consolidated them in order to make it more organized and fit the semantic structure. 

    In conclusion the site now runs properly and is made semantically correct.
